  // default state (Flash mode + new chat) instead of silently picking a
  // different PTC workspace the user didn't ask for. Resolve both decisions
  // before calling either setter so neither updater runs a side effect on the
  // other piece of state.
  //
  // Gated on a successful fetch that happened during this mount, not merely on
  // data being present: the query has a 30s staleTime, so a remount inside
  // that window is served from cache synchronously and a workspace deleted
  // elsewhere is still in that copy. `isFetchedAfterMount` also flips on an
  // error update, hence `isSuccess`: a failed list load must not read as
  // "your workspace is gone" and clear the selection.
  //
  // Once per mount, deliberately. Absence from this list does not mean
  // deleted: it is one page of 50 ordered by recency, so an idle selection
  // falls off it on its own as other workspaces get activity. Re-running on
  // every refetch would clear the selection mid-session on a window focus, and
  // MarketChatPanel reads a workspace change as a scope change the user made
  // and discards the open thread.
  //
  // So when the account has more workspaces than the page holds, a restored id
  // missing from it is asked about directly while still held, and dropped only
  // on a not-found or forbidden answer. That one request names the id. Storage
  // is per user, so the id is this account's own (bar an unscoped value from
  // before that, adopted once), and a drop replaces the stored id: a stale one
  // draws a single refusal, not one per load. A page that holds every
  // workspace settles it alone, naming nothing.
  //
  // A workspace named by the link is trusted outright: the chart tab built
  // that link from a workspace that was open seconds earlier, and one older
  // than the page's fifty is exactly the case this check would misread as
  // deleted, dropping the thread the link carried. So is an id selected since
  // mount, from the selector or a later link: it is the user's choice, and a
  // check that lands after it (the first success after a failed load, or the
  // direct check) must not overrule it.
  //
  // A failed load releases the restored id without judging it: its requests
  // may 403, but a list outage must not leave PTC mode unusable. A failed
  // check does the same.
