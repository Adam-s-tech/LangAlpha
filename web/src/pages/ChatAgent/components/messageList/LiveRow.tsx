/**
 * Enter/exit wrapper for the live-zone rows that never hands framer `auto`.
 *
 * framer cannot tween from `auto`: to resolve the exit keyframes it jumps the
 * row's inline height to 0, forces a layout, measures, then restores. During
 * that one forced layout the transcript is a whole row shorter, Chromium
 * clamps the chat scroll container's scrollTop to the shorter content, and the
 * clamp survives the restore, so the view jumps up at the first frame of every
 * fold of a tall row. framer only guards the window scroll, not an inner
 * scroller. Measuring the content ourselves keeps every keyframe in px.
 *
 * Growth is written to the box at the commit that caused it, from a
 * MutationObserver, which runs in the microtask after React's DOM writes and
 * ahead of the frame's ResizeObserver pass. A height that went through React
 * state and framer's frameloop lands one frame after the content did, and
 * that frame paints the new line clipped to half its glyphs. Writing it from
 * this row's own ResizeObserver instead is also a frame late for the follow:
 * the transcript's observer sits above this one, so a size it is handed from
 * a deeper callback is delivered on the next pass, with a loop error on every
 * growth frame. The ResizeObserver stays for growth that is not a mutation
 * (fonts, images).
 *
 * Only the live zone folds while the follow is pinning the reader to the end,
 * which is where the clamp shows; panels the reader opens and closes by hand
 * elsewhere in the transcript still animate `auto` and are a follow-up.
