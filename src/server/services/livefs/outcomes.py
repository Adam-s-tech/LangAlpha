"""What code saved through the mount, for the tool call that ran it.

A save through the mount fails at close() with nothing but an errno, so the
reason reaches the agent in the result of the tool call that ran the code:
the daemon tags each request with the call id of the process making it, the
server files the outcome under that id, and the tool collects the list when
its command returns. A process still saving after that, such as a background
job, files under its thread's late list, which the next command in that
thread picks up. A save whose call left no thread on file goes to the
computer's late list, which the next command anywhere on it picks up.

Redis only: an outcome is a report, not state, and losing one to a Redis
outage costs a line in a tool result, never a save.
