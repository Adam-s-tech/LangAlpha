/**
 * A block of the transcript that folds shut and back open, in px.
 *
 * Every keyframe is a number measured from the content: framer cannot tween
 * from `auto`, and resolving an `auto` keyframe inside the chat scroller jumps
 * the box to its target for one forced layout, where Chromium clamps the
 * scroll offset to the shorter transcript and keeps the clamp. Once open the
 * box hands its height back to the content (`auto`), so a reasoning row or
 * accordion opening inside it is never clipped; a close first freezes the
 * current px, then tweens down. Content that grows while the panel is opening
 * (an accordion unfolding beneath it) retargets the running spring rather than
 * waiting for it.
 *
 * Children are mounted only while the panel is open or moving: a long thread
 * keeps dozens of folded turns, and their process should cost nothing.
 *
 * The list spaces its blocks with a sibling margin that vanishes the moment a
 * panel is hidden, and lands again the moment it is not. That step is folded
 * into the motion: a negative bottom margin cancels the neighbour's gap in
 * proportion to how far the panel is closed, so the last frame of a close and
 * the first of an open move nothing.
