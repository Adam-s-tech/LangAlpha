"""Request URLs whose query string is the user's content.

The file mount's daemon names the file it reads or saves in ``path=`` and
``to=``, and the file panel, a share link and the memo routes name files the
same way. An automation's file is named after the automation, which operator
records leave out (``ptc_agent.core.paths.logged_path``). The two records that
would otherwise keep the whole URL, uvicorn's access line and the server span,
keep its path alone for every mount request and for any request whose query
names a file in the automations folder.
